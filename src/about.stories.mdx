# About us

Bannerboyâ€™s mission is to support the free internet by improving the online ad experience. Free, ad-funded platforms have toppled dictators and made the internet the awesome place it is today.
To keep it rockin' we carefully craft ads and branded content that delights, informs, entertains, and excites.

Our culture is collaborative, open-minded, ego-free, and non-corporate. We strive for honest and transparent collaboration with our clients because it makes better work, and it makes work better.
Established in 2010, our offices are in Stockholm, Amsterdam, New York City, and Los Angeles.
