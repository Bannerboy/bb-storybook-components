# Voice & Tone

We talk like real people, always really friendly and trying to keep it as clear and casual as possible. We like to use smilies, emoji, and gif’s.
We avoid industry jargon and abbreviations as much as possible because we’re not trying to come off as knowledgeable. We are knowledgeable and confident enough to share expertise.
We talk a strange mix of British and American english, but we should probably choose one.
