# BB Design System

A place where everything related to the Bannerboy brand lives with examples [what the heck is a design system anyways?](https://uxdesign.cc/what-the-heck-is-a-design-system-c89a8ea73b0d)

## Getting started

This project is using
[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) & React

You'll need to do the following:

1. Clone the repo (duh)
2. Install dependencies by running `yarn install`

## Running development

Once the dependencies are installed, you need to run `yarn start` and once the build finishes runing, it will open a new tab on your browser running the local server on port `6006`
